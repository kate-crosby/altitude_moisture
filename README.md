# Altitude, moisture, temperature
Quick grab of rasters and comparison of SA and Mex. 

# Steps
1. Run the test.R file - for the final raster of elevation (lines 109-onward) - this needs to be run on a cluster or a powerful machine than mine. It is too large for my little laptop to handle.
2. Play with color ramps, limits, interpolation in said file. 

# To do:

Pull points from dataframes and plot 3d surfaces of environments? Meh.
