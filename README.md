# altitude_moisture
quick grab of rasters and comparison of SA and Mex

# Steps
1. Download occurrences.csv file.
2. Take the loadcrop.R script - run it - will produce maps from rasters.

# Questions/concerns

1. Need to add more layers? I have phosphorus and other soil sets
2. As much as it would be cool to look at predictor variation with a GLM or other things, altitude is a DEM not generated in the same way, and the extent is different than precipitation and temperature. We can look at temp/prec gradients - if this is of interest.
